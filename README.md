A straightforward and simple application that provides a catalog of movies. 
Made w/ Flutter.

## Description
This movie catalog app is made for my first internship assigntment in PT Mejakita Edunusa Mandiri. This app provides a brief information about some movies. Numbers of basic mobile app development features with Flutter are implemented here, such as pagination, login with its form validations and List View along with the search and filter feature through the list.
